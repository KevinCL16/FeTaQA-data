Look at the table rows that contain the candidate's information and vote counts. 2. Find the candidate with the highest number of votes. 3. Identify the second-place finisher. 4. Calculate the vote lead by subtracting the votes of the second-place finisher from the winner. 5. Provide the answer as the winner's name and the vote lead.  Based on the information in the provided table, Al Franken won the 2008 United States Senate election in Minnesota. The table row corresponding to Al Franken shows that he received 1,212,431 votes. The second-place finisher, Norm Coleman, received 1,212,206 votes.   Calculating the vote lead by subtracting the votes received by Norm Coleman from Al Franken's votes, we get:  1,212,431 - 1,212,206 = 225  Therefore, Al Franken holds a 225-vote lead in the 2008 United States Senate election in Minnesota.
