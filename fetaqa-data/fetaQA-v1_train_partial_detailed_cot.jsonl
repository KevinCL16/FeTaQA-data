How many spectators attended the 1976 VFL Grand Final?  Locating relevant cells: The relevant information can be found in the following cells of the table: - Row: Saturday, 25 September 2:30pm | Hawthorn | def. | North Melbourne | MCG (crowd: 110,143) - Row: [ROW] - | 5.6 (36) 9.12 (66) 10.18 (78) 13.22 (100) | Q1 Q2 Q3 Final | 4.2 (26) 7.5 (47) 10.8 (68) 10.10 (70)  Chain-of-Thought rationale: 1. To determine the year of the Grand Final, we need to look at the table information. 2. The winning team can be identified by the \"def.\" in the second row of the table. This is Hawthorn. 3. The margin of victory can be calculated by subtracting the total points scored by the losing team from the total points scored by the winning team. In this case, it is 100 - 70 = 30 points. 4. The number of spectators can be found in the parentheses next to \"MCG\" in the first row of the table. There were 110,143 spectators.  Answer:  The 1976 VFL Grand Final was played between Hawthorn and North Melbourne. Hawthorn won the match by a margin of 30 points, and there were 110,143 spectators in attendance. "}

Locating relevant cells: The relevant cells are in the table under the columns \"Season\", \"Rate\", \"TD\", and \"Int\".  Chain-of-Thought rationale: 1. To find Russell Wilson's passer ratings in 2012 and 2013, we need to look for the corresponding rows in the table. 2. In the row with \"Season\" 2012, we find the passer rating under the column \"Rate\", which is 100.0. 3. In the row with \"Season\" 2013, we find the passer rating under the column \"Rate\", which is 101.2. 4. To find the number of touchdowns Russell Wilson had in 2013, we look for the corresponding row and find the value under the column \"TD\", which is 26. 5. To find the number of interceptions Russell Wilson had in 2013, we again look for the corresponding row and find the value under the column \"Int\", which is 9.
